In particular, we will concentrate on the non-harmonic distortion incurred by quantizing a pure sinusoid when the amplitude of the sinusoid is small compared to the quantization step. Since non-harmonic distortion is quite jarring acoustically, this side effect of quantization can be relatively noticeable even in CD-quality audio if not properly mitigated by more advanced techniques such as dithering."

    "An $M$-level uniform scalar quantizer implements a nonlinear function $q: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\{\\hat{x}_0, \\ldots, \\hat{x}_{M-1}\\}$ that projects the real axis onto a set of $M$ discrete values. The expected operating range for the input values defines a so-called _non-overload_ region, which for simplicity we assume to be the $[-1,1]$ interval. This interval is is divided into $M$ equal-size contiguous bins, half closed on the left, and an input value within the non-overload region will be mapped to a quantized value that coincides to the midpoint of the bin the input falls in; input values outside of the overload region will be mapped to the first or the last quantized values, as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $N$ is even, the quantizer is called a _mid-riser_ and an input value of zero will be mapped to the first positive quantization level. Conversely, when $M$ is odd, the quantizer is called a _deadzone quantizer_ and zero will be quantized to zero. \n",

    "## Tsividis' Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume $x(t)$ is a bandlimited continuous-time signal with spectral support over $[-f_0, f_0]$. The textbook A/D conversion scheme cascades a sampler at a sampling frequency $F_s > 2f_0$ with a $M$-level memoryless uniform scalar quantizer like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"400\" src=\"img/sbq.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $x(t)$ is bandlimited, $x[n]$ is a lossless representation of the analog signal; the distortion introduced by the quantizer is usually modeled as additive discrete-time white noise with uniform power spectral density equal to $\\Delta^2/12$, where $\\Delta$ is the quantization step (and, in our setup, $\\Delta = 2/M$). This _high resolution_ model is in fact a linearization of the quantization process which works reasonably well provided that $M$ is sufficiently large and that the input does not overload the quantizer. More specifically, for the hypothesis to hold, it must be $|x[n]| <  1$ and $\\Delta$ must be sufficiently small compared to the excursion of the input values; this implies that we expect the input to be \"full range\" and that all the quantization levels are in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here comes Yannis Tsividis' key observation: since quantization and sampling are both memoryless operations, their order can be interchanged like so without affecting the overall result:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"400\" src=\"img/qbs.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since the function $q$ is discontinuous, it is clear that $\\hat{x}(t)$ is no longer bandlimited and therefore the sampling operation will incur aliasing. While in general the aliasing will be sufficiently complicated as to appear similar to a noise floor, in the case of simple input signals (such as a sinusoid) and few quantization levels, the spectral structure of the noise can be decidedly non-white.

    " * **harmonic** distortion produces unwanted spectral content at integer multiples of $\\omega_c$; think for instance of turning a sinusoid into a square wave via two-level quantization. This type of distortion, while audible, is considered acoustically acceptable within certain limits since it follows the spectral pattern of most naturally occurring periodic sounds.\n",
    " * **non-harmonic** distortion, conversely, will appear as spectral lines at frequencies that are not a multiple of $\\omega_c$; since this distortion is not harmonically related to the frequency of the sinusoid, it will sound spurious and will be much more disturbing; needless to say, this is the kind of distortion introduced by aliasing."

Nevertheless, Tsividis claims that, in early CD releases, the type of distortion introduced by quantization was not yet well understood and, in some cases, low-amplitude simple waveforms exhibited clear signs of nonlinear distortion. \n",

    "A typical example of a recording that could cause trouble is given by Ravel' Bolero. The piece begins with a melody played by a single flute and ends with an orchestral _tutti_; the dynamic moves from an inital _pianissimo_ to a final a _fortissimo_ for an acoustic dynamic range that in a live performance exceeds 100dB. Since this is more than the dynamic range provided by a CD, some compression during mastering must be deployed in order to avoid clipping.

    "The linearized model for uniform quantization fails when the high-resolution hypotheses are not fulfilled. In the simple case of a quantized sinusoid, theoretical models show how the quantization noise is due to aliased harmonics at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. For sufficiently large frequencies at low amplitude with respect to the expected input range, the noise can take the form of perceptually disturbing non-harmonic distortion. Modern music mastering techniques do circumvent this problem by using dithering."
